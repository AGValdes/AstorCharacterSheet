                     Astor was born in the port city of Trusk. Her mother, Ashe, was a young Human seamstress, and her father, Alistair, was an Elven soldier of Tirathar’s Ivory Garrison. They met when Alistair was still in inphantry, he had been appointed into a security detail group that was to escort a Tiratharan noble through the city of Trusk. After a short affair, Astor was conceived and raised briefly by her mother in Trusk.

                    Astor’s early childhood was a happy one, although she doesn’t remember much. She was a happy, curious toddler. She spent a lot of her time with her mother watching her weave fabrics and make garments while she told stories of her valiant father. He was a white knight, brilliant to behold, she would say, and he would stop at nothing to protect his home. As a young child she enjoyed playing in the woods around their home, gathering flowers and pebbles and whatever pretty things she could find. She was also very social, loving and affectionate with her friends and family. Her innocent wonder of the world around her brought light into the lives of everyone she met.

                    When Astor turned 5 her life would change forever. She loved to look at the ships as they dropped their anchors and drew their sails. She had lost track of time and before she knew it, it had turned dusk. As she decided she had better find her way home, everything went black in an instant. She came-to in the cargo deck of a pirate ship on its way to the slave market. She was bound and surrounded by many other children of all races, one of them being Erika Kindelwood. When they reached port they were quickly sold as house girls to a local family who had made their wealth mining Emeralds, where they were treated neglectfully, but not outright horribly. The only item she had to remember her mother was a scrap of needle point she had kept in her pocket that her mother had made. It was bordered in elegant gold thread and depicted a pink peony.

                    Erika and Astor have, since childhood, an unbreakable bond of love and friendship. Growing up slaves in the same household, they have been each other’s rock virtually their entire lives. They have spent long, hungry nights together, cried together, and persevered together. Their relationship over the years blossomed into a fierce romantic love as well. When their masters caught wind of their activities, they were punished severely. Astor’s harrowing memory is that of witnessing her love being relentlessly punished and then whisked away to be sold by their angry masters. Again, her life was uprooted in an instant. That day, she stole away in the night, killing anyone that got in her way, taking only the clothes on her back and 2 items: a locket given to her by Erika containing a dried baby’s breath flower, and her mother’s needlepoint.

                    For a few years she continued this way, always on the run and in hiding. She would steal food, armor, weapons, whatever she needed to get by. She had an affinity for stealing armor pieces specifically, she could use all the protection she could get. Once she found passage off of Zamrak, she no longer was on the run from her masters. Without any real plan or direction, she found some odd jobs for coin, and continued to travel, making her way to Vestara. Her new found security gave her plenty of time to ponder the actions that had led her up to this point, and she became stricken with grief and guilt, haunted in her sleep by her past. This year, at her lowest, she found a church marked with the symbol of a thornless rose. Farelieth, Goddess of Beauty.

                    And a beautiful church it was. The walls were adorned with glimmering, intricate tapestries. They reminded her of her memories of her mother. She learned the tenants of the church and wept, as she realized she had strayed from the path of light and beauty that she knew had lived within her since she was a child. For the first time in many years, she had felt warm, safe, she felt loved. From that moment forward she swore to devote her life to protecting that light and enjoying all of the beautiful things life still had to offer. She swore to never cause suffering to another living thing. She decided to strive for beauty of character, and to take comfort in the natural beauty of the world, art, and those she surrounded herself with.

                    Her new life path illuminated, Astor now finds herself heading to Trusk. She heard of a ship heading in that direction and the name of the town sounded familiar. Perhaps it was where she was from? It must have been important in her life before being sold. She can’t recall, but decided to hop aboard and find out.

                    Astor has a foggy memory of her family, as she was taken as a young girl and quickly whisked away to be sold on the markets at Roger’s Doger. Sometimes in the night she will have dreams of her father, a brilliant white night. She has small faded memories of her mother’s dexterous hands weaving thread and creating extravagant garments.
